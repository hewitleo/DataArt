‚ôø Accessibility Statement
This project was built to be inclusive and accessible to all users. Key accessibility features include:

‚úÖ WCAG 2.1 AA Color Contrast: All text and UI elements meet the minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio in both light and dark modes. Through rigorous testing, we ensured that both modes are fully readable and pass WCAG AA standards.

‚úÖ Full Keyboard Navigation: All interactive elements, including the theme toggle, timeline markers, and modal controls, are fully accessible and operable using only a keyboard.

‚úÖ Visible Focus Indicators: Clear and consistent focus outlines ensure keyboard users always know their location on the page.

‚úÖ Semantic HTML: Uses semantic elements like <dialog> and <header> for improved screen reader support.

‚úÖ Reduced Motion: Honors the prefers-reduced-motion media query to disable animations for users who are sensitive to motion.
